# Single-Cycle MIPS Processor

## Introduction

Welcome to the Single-Cycle MIPS Processor repository. This project presents a complete design and implementation of a single-cycle MIPS processor, adhering to the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA). The primary objective is to create a processor that can execute each instruction within a single clock cycle, providing an efficient and straightforward design approach.

## Features

- **Single-Cycle Execution**: The processor is designed to execute each instruction in a single clock cycle, resulting in a simplified control logic and efficient processing.
- **MIPS ISA Compatibility**: The processor strictly adheres to the MIPS instruction set architecture, ensuring compatibility with existing MIPS programs, compilers, and development tools.
- **Arithmetic and Logic Operations**: The processor supports a range of arithmetic and logic operations, including addition, subtraction, logical AND, logical OR, and more, providing essential computation capabilities.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Single-Cycle MIPS Processor is based on the MIPS ISA and comprises the following key components:

- **Instruction Memory (IMem)**: This component stores the program instructions that need to be executed by the processor.
- **Data Memory (DMem)**: The data memory is used for data storage and facilitates load and store operations within the processor.
- **Control Unit**: The control unit governs the overall operation of the processor, ensuring correct instruction execution and proper handling of control signals.
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations on data based on the instruction being executed.
- **Registers**: The register file stores data that is being processed by the ALU and other components of the processor.

For a detailed and in-depth understanding of the architecture and its components, please refer to the source files and accompanying documentation within this repository.

## Implementation

The implementation of the Single-Cycle MIPS Processor is primarily done using Hardware Description Language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL. The design involves defining the components and interconnections, ensuring their proper functionality, and strictly adhering to the specifications of the MIPS ISA.

The repository contains comprehensive source files, including HDL files, testbenches, and supporting scripts. These resources provide a thorough insight into the implementation of the processor.
